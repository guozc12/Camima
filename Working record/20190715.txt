1. First, we define the new name method for new OD.

2. secound, we will test Na OD with counting method.
When testing counting method for OD, we find the counting result is easily affected by background
value, when size of ROI get larger and larger, which cause the result much un-precise
so what we expect is that by choosing a background the number of atom will be independent from
the size we crop.

For now, the idea is clear, but how to deploy this method to get proper background?

Question: Is the mainly problem about the background value taking?

A. maybe the better way is that: we can crop the outer side image get its mean as counting background, which seems
directly solve the problem of vary of number with crop size.
B. Why not just use total number from double peak as the final value?

3. For the next step we will implement new OD for Rb picture, because Rb old OD get many wrong value
problem is that we do not see any steps on 200 which means there is /????? no cut of log??? no ,because this 
value is caculate from cutlog plus modify, which means if cutlog give zero, plus the 200 offset, 
and plus also the high intensity modification, we can still get ramdom value.
If we calcualte Log0.8 we get -0.2 around, and them due to add the intensity correction, we will meet the case that for
cutlog is OK, we can calculate some negative value larger than -0.2 however after adding the lineare correction , we will
meet (200+1000*cutlog + linear coorection) still nagetive value, which cause our problem.

so the correct way to do this maybe is cut again outside the whole fomula.

Notice: when save a image, we always change numerical value to unsigned int, which may cause probelm
when we save a negative value to unsigned int.

to choose proper background value and proper cutlog bound is depend on how much noise we will have.

by checking Na image, we get the fluctuation of light and atom is +/- 40 counting, which will cause maxium negative around
-40/87 - 0.1 is about -0.6. For Rb we have -100/39 -0.2 about -2.6 thus , we add 3000 as offset thus ,there will be not broken image
any more.
